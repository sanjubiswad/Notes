/etc/ansible/hosts used for store ip address
instead of this we can use inventory file to store ip address

vim inventory
= [dbservers]
172.31.62.28

[webservers]
172.31.62.100

ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch devopsclass"
-m = module
-a = to run shell command

ansible -i inventory webservers -m "shell" -a "touch devopsclass"

tasks:
 - name: install nginx
   apt:
     name: nginx
	 state: present
or,
   shell: apt install nginx 
   
ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory first-playbook.yml
(inventory file should be in same location)

-vvv = debug every details, it will show every step to apply playbook
