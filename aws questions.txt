auto scaling
=====================
-> horizontal scale up 
= it will create more ec2 with same specification

-> vertical scale up
= it will inrease ram or storage or high specification ec2

1. manual scaling , 
2.dynamic scaling
 a. target tracking policy = it will try to 
    fix load in fixed target value (like cpu 70%)
	
 b. simple scaling policy = simply add number of instances if its 
    reach fixed cpu usage
	
 c. step scaling policy = it will add step like if its 50-60% lead then
    add 1 one or more instaces
	
	
Load balancer
===================
1. application load balancer - layer 7 protocols
2. network load balancer - layer 4 protocols - transport layer
3. classic loqad balancer - both layer 4 and 7

icmp protocols dont need to go through load balancer
because its not works on layer 4 or 7

Route 53
====================
dns for aws
1. dns managment
2.traffic management
3.availability management
4. domain registration


cloudwatch
====================
it work like a gatekipper, for cpu usage alarm, dashboard, metric

private subnet

**bastion host
=typically use "jump box" (NAT/proxy/bastion host)to support
 restricted outbound only public internet access
ssh connectivity or port forward

cidr = classless inter-domain routing
 10.0.0.0/16 ips from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
 
security groups = ec2 instances
NACL = subnet level

local= subnet
destination = vpc,nat gateway, virtual private gateway, vpc endpoint

rt1 - vpc hit - route to public subnet

----------------------
Lambda
----------------------
deploy python lambda function with .zip file archives
deployment package with dependencies
1. mkdir my-sourcecode-function
2. cd my-sourcecode-function
3. vim lambda_function.py
4. pip install --target ./package requests
5. cd package
zip -r ../my-deployment-package.zip . 
6. cd ..
zip -g my-deployment-package.zip lambda_function.py


route53
-------------
1.type of routing policy
 = latency-based routing = user latency can be reduced by serving request from the region where network latency
 is the lowest
 geo DNS = geoloaction can be used to send traffic to resources based on the geographic 
 weighted round-robin = two region servers are there we can divide the traffic based on 
 
2. what is route 53
3. how you integrate route53 with load balancer
 

S3 bucket
-----------------
what is cross origin resource sharing?
what are the types of s3 bucket?
what types of bucket used in your project?
what is versioning in bucket?
s3 lifecycle

**whenever there is code upload in S3 it will automatically triggered lambda


application load balancer
---------------------------
an ALB only works at - LAYER 7 (HTTP). it has a wide range of
 routing rules for incomming request based on host name
path, query string, http method, http headers, source IP,
 or port number.
 
** ELB only allows routing based on port number

ALB can route request to many ports on a single target.
Plus , ALB can route requests to lambda functions

ALB further supports server name indication(SNI), which allows it to serve many domain names

there is limit, however to the number of certificate you can 
attach to an ALB, namely 25 certificates plus the default certificate.

ALB are typically used for web applications.


Network load balancer
----------------------------
layer 4 load balancer
NLB would be used for anthing that ALB dont cover . A typical use case would 
be a near real time data streaming service (video,stock qoutes etc).
