auto scaling
-> horizontal scale up 
= it will create more ec2 with same specification

-> vertical scale up
= it will inrease ram or storage or high specification ec2

1. manual scaling , 
2.dynamic scaling
 a. target tracking policy = it will try to 
    fix load in fixed target value (like cpu 70%)
	
 b. simple scaling policy = simply add number of instances if its 
    reach fixed cpu usage
	
 c. step scaling policy = it will add step like if its 50-60% lead then
    add 1 one or more instaces
	
	
Load balancer
===================
1. application load balancer - layer 7 protocols
2. network load balancer - layer 4 protocols - transport layer
3. classic loqad balancer - both layer 4 and 7

icmp protocols dont need to go through load balancer
because its not works on layer 4 or 7
