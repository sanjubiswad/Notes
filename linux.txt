useradd tom
id tom

2. touch /tmp/test
chattr +i /tmp/test (file will not delete even if we use root)
rm -rf /tmp/test
#operation not permitted

chattr -i /tmp/test (then file will be deleted)

3. rpm -qf /etc/hosts
#setup-2.12.noarch
touch /tmp/test
rpm -qf /tmp/test
file is not owned by any package

 rpm -ivh httpd.centos.rpm
 (i = install, v= verbos, h=hash)
 -qPR = dependencies to check for particular package

data will be linked to the linked file
but in soft link data will be lost

6. sticky bit on folder
only owner/root can delete the folder 

7. netstat -tunlp (to check which port is open)

8. yum install nmap
nmap -A 8.8.8.8 (to check particular port of remote server)
